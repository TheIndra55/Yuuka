# Yuuka
A Discord bot where you create commands that display texts/images/audios

The idea is simple, you begin by creating a tag
```
.create tagName tagContent
```
And then you can use it by doing
```
.tagName
```
Who will display
```
tagContent
```

tagContent can either be text, or an image/audio file (you'ld need to send it in attachment).
<br/>
<br/>
The bot would then display the text/image or play the audio file in vocal channel

## Invite link
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=734788725388869742&scope=bot

## Rules
If you use the invite link below there are 2 rules you should know:
 - Tags are global, which mean they can be used between servers so don't send NSFW content or audio with sound too loud
 - My storage is limited so don't keep sending huge files
 
If you fail to comply, the bot will be removed from your server and you'll be banned.
